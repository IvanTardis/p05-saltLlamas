## Description
We are providing a fully customizable game engine for the hit classic Oregon Trail. One can relive the nostalgia of the old game and trek across the Oregon Trail, or they can select a destination of their own choice and journey there instead. Other customizable options include wagon design, background design, and much, much more! See your stats in your user profile and try, try, again for better results! For those with limited respites, this game is designed for short gameplay loops but long term satisfaction much like games with roguelike elements in mind.
